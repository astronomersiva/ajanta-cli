# ajanta-cli

This is a command line utility that I use to generate resized images
for various resolutions and to also get pixelated versions that I
use for lazy loading with [ajanta](https://github.com/astronomersiva/ajanta).

### Usage

- `inputDir` - Specify the input directory, defaults to `process.cwd()`.
- `resolutions` - A comma separated list of image resolutions.
- `webp` - If webp images are needed. Defaults to `true`.
